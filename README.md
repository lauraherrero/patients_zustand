#  Veterinary patients 🏥 🐕 ❤️‍🩹

## Summary: 📝

https://patients-zustand-react.netlify.app/

Project based on the follow-up of veterinary patients.

You can see a page with access to a form with different fields about the pet's data (name, owner, date, symptoms, etc). When all the fields are filled in, we can save them and they will appear on the right side, in the list of patients. And also a toast will be shown indicating that the action has been performed correctly.
In case any field is not filled in, a message will be displayed below the field indicating that it cannot be left empty.

In the list of patients we can perform different actions such as editing or deleting.
The edit button allows you to fill in the form fields with the information and modify the data required by the user. When we press the save button, the information will be updated and the toast will show us a message that the information has been updated correctly.

Finally, we can also delete patients. By pressing the button, the information will disappear from the list.

Even if the page is reloaded, the information will remain thanks to the localStorage storage.


## Technology Stack 💻
The application has been made from scratch with React using Vite and zustand, which provides a centralized status management system that allows status to be shared among multiple components in an efficient way.
